This models Millikan's oil drop experiment using ODEs to model the oscillation of a charged particle falling on a charged disk.
MATLAB has a very specific format for solving ODEs, so this implements that format of solving for a system of linear first order equations
and using the inital value conditions. 

I also have code for implementing Huen's method, Midpoint method, Euler's method for solving ODEs.
